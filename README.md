Persons with heart failure require a good understanding of heart failure in order to minimize exacerbation of the disease process and maintain quality of life. Recent clinical guidelines recommend that clinicians counsel persons with heart failure about lifestyle modifications such as medications, a low sodium diet, activity modifications, as well as symptoms of deterioration. It is especially important to learn whether persons with heart failure have an adequate understanding of heart failure, in order to enable them to participate in their own self-care. Although there is evidence that patient education can improve outcomes of persons with heart failure, there may be a discrepancy between persons with heart failure and health care providers about what information is most important.  reported a general trend for patients to rate all heart failure education content as more important to learn than nurses rated the information. Determining the educational 4 preferences and needs of persons with heart failure is a critical first step toward improved outcomes. We have tried to come up with an evaluation of a person’s heart risk factors considering his/her blood pressure, heart-beat rate, blood oxygen level.
